## Notes from First Evaluation

### Introduction

Purpose and Background: The introduction effectively sets the stage by discussing the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4 and GitHub Copilot in the context of programming education. The author explains how LLMs are transforming both professional programming and programming education, with specific attention to their challenges, such as plagiarism and difficulties in evaluating student comprehension.

Problem Definition: The problem is well-defined: educators face challenges in assessing students’ programming abilities when LLMs are widely available and can produce accurate code. The proposal highlights the risk of students relying too heavily on these tools without developing foundational programming skills.

Clarity: The introduction provides a coherent overview of the purpose and significance of the study, clearly identifying the focus on adapting teaching methods in response to AI-driven changes in the programming field

Suggestions for Improvement:

Impact on Future Education: Expanding on how these AI tools might affect future trends in programming careers and education could provide more context.

Educational Setting Details: Including more specifics about the course or academic setting (e.g., targeted class level, student demographics) would further clarify the scope of the study.


### Review of Relevant Research

Depth and Relevance: The literature review is thorough and covers relevant studies on academic integrity, alternative evaluation methods, and AI’s impact on introductory programming education. The references include current and reputable sources, such as work on AI in programming and the use of code reviews in educational settings.

Integration of Sources: The proposal effectively integrates sources, using them to establish a foundation for the proposed solution. For instance, the references to ICAI (International Center for Academic Integrity) offer insights into fostering environments that encourage academic honesty, aligning with the proposal’s emphasis on academic integrity in an AI-pervasive climate.

Critical Analysis: The review provides critical insights into different approaches, such as the benefits of “Explain in Plain English” (EiPE) questions and the limitations of traditional code review methods. The author also draws connections between restrictive academic policies and observed increases in dishonest behavior, which supports the need for alternative teaching strategies.

Suggestions for Improvement:

Comparative Analysis: A more explicit comparison of the different teaching and assessment strategies explored in the literature could clarify why the proposed methods are preferable.

Gap Identification: The review would benefit from a clearer articulation of gaps in current research or practices to strengthen the rationale for the proposed methods.

### Methods

Proposed Solution: The methods section presents a comprehensive solution to the problem, comprising five main components: lectures, low-stakes participation, coding assignments, code reviews, and bounded grading. The proposed solution is well-structured and seems adaptable to existing course structures, allowing flexibility without major curriculum overhauls.

Detailed Plan:
Lectures: The approach of focusing lectures on code comprehension rather than syntax memorization is well-articulated, with specific steps outlined to foster deeper understanding.

Low-Stakes Participation: The use of participation activities to engage students and reduce the impact of mistakes on their grades is an effective strategy to encourage honest engagement.

Coding Assignments and Code Reviews: The emphasis on understanding rather than rote coding performance is highlighted through code reviews, where students explain and analyze code in context.

Bounded Grades: This innovative approach to grade bounding directly addresses the issue of AI usage, encouraging students to understand rather than simply reproduce code.

Suggestions for Improvement:

Pilot Study: Including a pilot study or trial period could help validate the efficacy of the proposed methods in a real-world setting.
Evaluation Metrics: Defining more specific metrics for assessing the success of each component, especially in terms of improving student understanding and maintaining academic integrity, would strengthen the methodology.

### Formatting and APA Style

Length and Formatting: The proposal adheres to the required length, with double-spaced pages, size 12 Times New Roman font, and appropriate 1-inch margins. However, ensuring the final submission meets the 2,000-word requirement would be ideal without a precise word count here.

APA Compliance: Citations in the literature review are formatted according to APA guidelines, and the reference list appears to follow APA conventions, though minor details (like capitalization and italics) should be double-checked.

Grammar, Spelling, and Punctuation: The writing is mainly free of grammatical errors, and sentences are clear and easy to follow. Occasional proofreading could further polish the document to ensure no minor typographic issues remain.

## Notes from Second Evaluation

### Introduction

Sentence Structure: Streamline some sentences for clarity. For instance, “Each day, it seems that new technologies appear which each give a promise of something more in some way” could be condensed to “Each day, new technologies emerge, each promising added capability.”

Clarity and Conciseness: Simplify complex sentences and avoid redundancy, such as rephrasing “The ability for LLMs to use and update context should not be understated” to “LLMs’ ability to use and update context is fundamental.”

Citation Needs: Several claims about LLM capabilities and the ethical challenges posed in academia require citations. Consider referencing recent studies on LLMs in education, such as their impact on student integrity and academic performance.

### Literature Review

Structure and Depth: The literature review should frame the problem more fully by including a comprehensive view of existing pedagogical methods and any historical approaches to teaching programming. Introduce more detail from each study, providing specific methods or findings rather than a summary.

Additional Citations: Include more foundational sources on learning theories that discuss constructivist and collaborative learning principles, as they are critical to supporting the pedagogical shifts proposed.
